## Data Collection
In this section, we will discuss the process of collecting movie data. We'll explore different data sources such as public APIs, scraping websites, and manual data entry.

- [ ] Explore available public movie APIs.
- [ ] Evaluate scraping websites for movie information.
- [ ] Consider manual data entry for movies not available through APIs or scraping.

## Web Application
Here, we will outline the development of a web application to showcase the movie database. The application will allow users to search for movies, view details, and leave ratings and reviews.

- [ ] Design the user interface and wireframes.
- [ ] Implement the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [ ] Create the back-end using a suitable framework (e.g., Django, Flask, Node.js).
- [ ] Integrate the movie data into the application.

## API Development
To provide programmatic access to movie information, we will build an API that allows developers to retrieve data from our movie database.

- [ ] Design the API endpoints and documentation.
- [ ] Develop the API using a framework (e.g., Django REST Framework, Express.js).
- [ ] Implement authentication and access control.
- [ ] Test the API thoroughly and document usage examples.
